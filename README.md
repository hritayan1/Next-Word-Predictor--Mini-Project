# Next-Word-Predictor--Mini-Project
The "Next-Word Predictor" is a mini-project in natural language processing that aims to suggest the most likely word to follow a given input word or phrase. It utilizes statistical language models, such as n-grams or more advanced deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, to make predictions. The project typically involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve accurate and contextually relevant predictions. It can be used in various applications, from autocomplete suggestions in text messaging and search engines to enhancing virtual assistants and chatbots. The goal is to improve user experience and assist in generating coherent and relevant text.
